            <h2>Our Bhakti</h2>
            <p>KRISHNA Coin is built on the principles of Sanatana-Dharma and the path of Bhakti Yoga — loving devotion and service to the Divine. Our mission is threefold:</p>
            <p>1. To create a sangha (community) centered around divine values, compassion, and mindfulness.<br>
            2. To utilize the energy of modern technology as an offering for positive spiritual impact (yajna).<br>
            3. To dedicate a significant portion of resources to supporting authentic projects that nourish the soul: Prasadam distribution, Goshala (cow protection), and the spreading of transcendental knowledge through Vedic scriptures like the Srimad Bhagavatam.</p>
            <p><em>"janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ... "</em><br>(Bhagavad Gita 4.9)</p>

            <h2>Utility & Holder Benefits</h2>
            <p>Holding KRISHNA is more than an investment; it's a commitment to a conscious ecosystem. We are building tangible utility and rewards for our dedicated community.</p>

            <h3>Sacred Holding Rewards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The 108-Day Sadhana Airdrop:</strong> Holders who maintain their tokens for a full <span class="highlight">108 days</span> (a sacred number representing spiritual completion in the Vedas) will be eligible for a  airdrop of the KRISHNA token when it launches on its next blockchain expansion. This rewards patience and long-term alignment with our mission.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Staking Rewards (Reflections):</strong> Part of the fees on every transaction will be automatically redistributed to all existing holders. This means your holdings grow passively simply by you holding, encouraging stability and rewarding faith in the project's daily activity. <em>(Technical note: This mechanism is built into the token's smart contract on launch).</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Utility (Under Development)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Long-term holders will gain voting rights to influence charitable decisions, guiding which Vedic initiatives and projects receive support from the treasury.</li>
                <li><strong>Access & Experiences:</strong> Potential future benefits include access to exclusive digital content (lectures, kirtans), discounts on pilgrimage tours, or VIP access to major spiritual festivals and events sponsored by the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Gift of Giving:</strong> Holders will be able to easily donate a portion of their reflections directly to verified charitable causes through an integrated dashboard, turning passive income into immediate seva (service).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>True wealth is not just in accumulation, but in conscious circulation and sharing. These mechanisms are designed to create a virtuous cycle of growth and giving.</em></p>

        <!-- НАЧАЛО: Новая секция "A Note to Holders" -->
        <section class="disclaimer">
            <h2>A Heartfelt Note to Fellow Seekers</h2>
            <p>This initiative is a sacred offering, a experiment in aligning modern technology with timeless spiritual principles. It is <span class="highlight">not a "pump and dump" scheme, a scam, or a rugpull</span>. Its value is meant to be a reflection of the collective spiritual energy and intention (sankalpa) behind it.</p>
            
            <p>We humbly appeal to those who are blessed with significant holdings ("whales"):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Please consider the deeper purpose. A sudden, large sale (dump) extinguishes the collective fire of devotion we are trying to kindle. We ask you to be mindful stewards of this energy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To every holder, we offer this contemplation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are blessed to make life-changing gains, consider this a divine gift (prasāda). The constant chase of profit (trading) is born of Rajas, the mode of passion, which agitates the mind and distracts from the soul's purpose. Perhaps this is a sign to redirect that energy towards Sattva—goodness, clarity, and spiritual development. Use this wealth for seva (service), sādhanā (practice), and supporting causes that uplift consciousness. That is the real "moon" we are aiming for.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="roadmap">
            <h2>Our Path Forward</h2>
            <p>A portion of the resources generated will be reinvested mindfully to grow this project's reach and impact, always in line with its core principles. This includes strategic development, charity, and <span class="highlight">ensuring healthy liquidity</span> for our community.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Focus (Seeding the Garden)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustaining the Project:</strong> A small, transparent portion of dev funds will be used for critical expenses: <span class="highlight">increasing liquidity pools on DEXs</span>, funding strategic marketing campaigns on centralized exchanges (CEXs), and covering essential operational costs. Please do not be alarmed by gradual, announced developer sales; they are essential fuel for this project's growth and stability, not a "rug pull".</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Design:</strong> Commission a professional website redesign from a designer who understands and respects Vedic aesthetics and principles.</li>
                <li><strong>Conscious Outreach:</strong> Strategic marketing to attract long-term, spiritually-aligned holders who believe in the mission, not just short-term speculation.</li>
                <li><strong>Expanding Reach:</strong> Launching KRISHNA token on additional blockchains to make it accessible to a wider audience. <span class="highlight"><em>Please note: Official contract addresses will ONLY ever be published on this website. Any other source is a scam.</em></span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We gently remind our community that this project's vitality depends on stable, conscious growth. We pray you will support this divine endeavor by holding with intention, not trading with agitation.</p>
            
            <h3>Long-Term Vision (The Harvest)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Temple:</strong> To fund the construction of a physical temple/dhāma dedicated to Lord Krishna, a first of its kind funded by a crypto community.</li>
                <li><strong>Divine Stewardship:</strong> To eventually transition governance and charitable distributions to a recognized and trusted spiritual foundation like <a href="https://iskcon.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #E65100;">ISKCON</a>, ensuring the project's longevity and integrity in serving the Divine will.</li>
